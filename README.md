Hey all,

This project was something I strung up for fun to try and merge a number of different technologies together. 

For the most part JIRA was a major influence on this project as anyone familiar with JIRA will see the similarities.

It uses PHP and SQLServer 2012 on the back end, Apache, and some front end technologies including jQuery, Mustache.js, and twitter bootstrap (plus some other public libraries).

I will most likely be rebuilding this soon using angularJS and Node/express to see if I can streamline all this code utilizing MVC.
